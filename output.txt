(a) The physical dependencies that govern the order in which these transactions are implemented are:
Create customer records: This must be done before invoices can be produced or amended, and before cash payments can be recorded.
Produce invoice: This can be done once customer records are created, but must be done before monthly statements can be produced.
Amend invoice: This can be done after invoices are produced, but before cash payments are recorded.
Record cash payment: This can be done after invoices are produced and amended, but must be done before paid invoices are cleared from the database.
Clear paid invoices from database: This can be done once cash payments are recorded, but must be done before customer records are deleted.
Produce monthly statements: This can be done once invoices are produced and before the paid invoices are cleared from the database.
Based on this analysis, pair programming may not be suitable in the following situations:
Tight deadlines: If there is a tight deadline fora project, it may not be practical to use pair programming, as it can be slower than working alone.
Inexperienced programmers: Pair programming requires a certain level of skill and experience, so it may not be suitable for less experienced programmers who need to focus on learning and developing their own skills.
Independent work: If a task requires a high degree of independent work, such as research or analysis, it may not be suitable for pair programming.
